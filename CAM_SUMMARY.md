We're now at **85% complete for V1 release** with a **3-4 week timeline to production**. This document provides a comprehensive overview of what's been accomplished and how the system is now wired together.

## 🚀 **MAJOR UPDATE: 85% Complete for V1 - 3-4 Weeks to Production!**

## Key Architectural Changes

### 1. Database Schema Evolution
The database structure has been refined and optimized:

**Current Schema (`db/config.ts`):**
- **Spaces**: Top-level organization units with color/gradient support
- **Threads**: Content containers that can belong to spaces or be standalone
- **Notes**: Individual content pieces with enhanced metadata
- **Comments**: Discussion system for notes
- **Members**: Space membership and role management
- **NoteThreads**: Junction table for many-to-many relationships (recently cleaned up)

**Key Improvements:**
- Added `simpleNoteId` field for user-friendly note identification (N001, N002, etc.)
- Enhanced color and gradient support for visual organization
- Improved indexing and relationship management
- Removed unused tables and optimized existing ones

### 2. Configuration & Build System
**Astro Configuration (`astro.config.mjs`):**
- Switched to static output for better performance and deployment
- Optimized Vite configuration with chunk splitting for Alpine.js and Trix editor
- Enhanced HMR (Hot Module Replacement) configuration
- Improved CSS handling and build optimization
- Added performance optimizations for development and production

**Package Management:**
- Updated to latest Astro version (5.5.5)
- Enhanced dependency management with specific versioning
- Added new utilities like `isomorphic-dompurify` for security

**Automatic Version Bumping System:**
- ✅ **Version Management**: Automatic version bumping based on conventional commit messages
- ✅ **Current Version**: 0.10.0 (displays in Get Support panel)
- ✅ **Git Hook**: Post-commit hook automatically bumps version after commits
- ✅ **Conventional Commits**: 
  - `feat:` → minor bump (0.10.0 → 0.11.0)
  - `fix:` → patch bump (0.10.0 → 0.10.1)
  - `BREAKING CHANGE` or `!` → major bump (0.10.0 → 1.0.0)
- ✅ **Scripts**: `npm run version:bump` (manual), `npm run version:check` (check version)
- **Setup Required**: Git hook at `.git/hooks/post-commit` needs to be set up manually (not tracked by git)
- **Files**: `scripts/bump-version.js` - Version bumping logic

## Core Functionality Improvements

### 3. Data Management System
**Robust Sample Data System (`src/utils/sample-data.ts`):**
- Clean, consistent development data without duplicates

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES - IMMEDIATE ATTENTION NEEDED**

### **🔥 HIGH PRIORITY - BLOCKING ISSUES**

#### **1. Clerk Authentication & Profile Updates - CRITICAL**
- **Problem**: User name, initials, and color not updating properly across the app
- **Impact**: Users can't update their profile information, poor UX, broken functionality
- **Root Cause**: Complex avatar update system with multiple selectors and event handling
- **Files Affected**: `src/pages/profile.astro`, `src/components/EditNameColorPanelReact.astro`
- **Current State**: Profile updates work in some contexts but fail in others
- **Solution Needed**: Simplify avatar update system, fix event handling, ensure consistent updates
- **Estimated Time**: 2-3 days
- **Priority**: **CRITICAL** - This is blocking user profile management

#### **2. Settings Panel Bugs - HIGH**
- **Problem**: Settings panels (Email & Password, My Church, My Data, Get Support) are buggy
- **Impact**: Users can't access settings functionality, poor UX
- **Current State**: Panels show "coming soon..." placeholders, but the panel switching system is broken
- **Files Affected**: `src/pages/profile.astro` (lines 276-298)
- **Solution Needed**: Fix panel switching logic, implement proper panel management
- **Estimated Time**: 1-2 days
- **Priority**: **HIGH** - Core functionality broken

#### **3. Profile Page Performance - HIGH**

## 🎯 **CURRENT PRIORITIES FOR CAM**

### **⚙️ SETUP REQUIRED: Version Bumping System**

**Git Hook Setup** (One-time setup):
Since `.git/hooks/` is not tracked by git, you need to set up the post-commit hook manually:

1. **Copy the hook file** (if not already present):
   ```bash
   # Check if hook exists
   ls -la .git/hooks/post-commit
   
   # If missing, create it:
   cat > .git/hooks/post-commit << 'EOF'
   #!/bin/sh
   node scripts/bump-version.js
   EOF
   chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
   ```

2. **Test the system**:
   ```bash
   # Check current version
   npm run version:check
   
   # Make a test commit with conventional commit message
   git commit -m "feat: test feature" --allow-empty
   # Version should auto-bump from 0.10.0 → 0.11.0
   ```

3. **How it works**:
   - After each commit, the hook runs `scripts/bump-version.js`
   - Script reads your commit message and determines bump type
   - Updates `package.json` automatically
   - Stages `package.json` for you to include in commit (amend or new commit)

**Important**: The hook skips version bump commits (starts with "chore: bump version") to avoid recursion.

### **🚨 IMMEDIATE FOCUS (Week 2): CRITICAL ISSUES FIX**
**These issues are BLOCKING V1 release and must be fixed first:**

1. **CRITICAL: Clerk Authentication & Profile Updates**
   - Fix user name, initials, and color not updating properly
   - Simplify avatar update system in `src/pages/profile.astro`

   - Ensure consistent updates across all avatar instances
   - **Estimated Time**: 2-3 days

2. **HIGH: Settings Panel Bugs**
   - Fix broken panel switching logic in `src/pages/profile.astro`
   - Implement proper panel management for Email & Password, My Church, My Data, Get Support
   - Replace "coming soon..." placeholders with functional panels
   - **Estimated Time**: 1-2 days

3. **HIGH: Profile Page Performance**
   - Refactor 700+ lines of complex JavaScript in `src/pages/profile.astro`
   - Convert to React component for better performance and maintainability
   - Simplify event handling and DOM manipulation
   - **Estimated Time**: 3-4 days

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DETAILS: PROFILE PAGE ISSUES**

### **Profile.astro Performance Problems**
- **File Size**: 705 lines with 400+ lines of complex JavaScript
- **Event Listeners**: Multiple overlapping event listeners causing conflicts
- **DOM Manipulation**: Complex avatar update system with 10+ selectors
- **Debugging**: Extensive console logging (100+ console.log statements)
- **Maintenance**: Difficult to debug and maintain

### **Avatar Update System Issues**
```javascript
// Current problematic approach in profile.astro (lines 358-474)
const avatarSelectors = [
  '#mobile-navigation-avatar',
  '#dashboard-navigation-avatar', 
  '#content-navigation-avatar',
  '#new-space-navigation-avatar',
  '.avatar-button',
  '[data-avatar-color]',
  'div[style*="background"][style*="var(--color-"]'
];
// This approach is overly complex and error-prone
```

### **Settings Panel Issues**
- **Panel Switching**: Broken logic for showing/hiding panels
- **Event Handling**: Multiple event listeners causing conflicts
- **State Management**: No proper state management for panel visibility
- **Placeholder Content**: All panels show "coming soon..." instead of functionality

### **Recommended Solutions**
1. **Convert to React Component**: Move profile page to React for better state management
2. **Simplify Avatar Updates**: Use a single, reliable method for avatar updates
3. **Fix Panel Management**: Implement proper panel state management
4. **Remove Debug Code**: Clean up excessive console logging
5. **Performance Optimization**: Reduce JavaScript complexity
