## What is Harvous?

Harvous is a note-taking and thread management application designed specifically for Bible study. It helps you organize your thoughts, insights, and reflections in a structured way that grows with your spiritual journey.

## Getting Started

### 1. Sign In
- Visit the Harvous app and sign in with your account
- Your notes are private and secure - only you can see them

  - **"Full List"**: All your organized content by spaces
- **Navigation**: Quick access to your spaces and threads
- **Create Buttons**: Add new notes, threads, and spaces

## Core Concepts

### Spaces
Think of **Spaces** as your main organizational folders:
- **"Bible Study"** - for your regular study notes
- **"Prayer Journal"** - for prayer requests and reflections
- **"Sermon Notes"** - for church service notes
- **"Personal Study"** - for your individual exploration

### Threads
**Threads** are collections of related notes within a space:
- **"Gospel of John Study"** - all your notes about John's Gospel
- **"Psalm 23 Deep Dive"** - notes exploring Psalm 23
- **"Prayer Requests 2024"** - your prayer list for the year
- **"Sunday Sermons"** - notes from weekly services

### Notes
**Notes** are your individual thoughts and insights:
- Each note has a title and rich text content
- Notes can include images, formatting, and links
- Every note gets a unique ID (like N001, N002, N003)
- Notes are never deleted - they're always preserved
