**Edit Thread Panel Implementation Attempt - FAILED**

- ❌ **Edit Thread Panel**: Attempted to implement missing "Edit Thread" functionality from thread page menu options
- ❌ **Custom Confirmation Dialog**: Tried to replace browser `confirm()` with custom styled dialog for delete actions
- ❌ **Event System Issues**: Complex event flow between Astro, Alpine.js, and React components proved unreliable
- ❌ **Component Architecture Problems**: Attempted to reuse `NewThreadPanel.tsx` for editing, creating confusion between create/edit modes
- ❌ **Data Flow Issues**: Thread data passing through multiple layers (Astro → Alpine.js → React) was fragile and hard to debug
- ❌ **Toast Notifications**: Delete actions still don't show success/error toasts despite event dispatching

**What Went Wrong:**
- Over-engineered solution with too many new components (`EditThreadPanel.tsx`, `ConfirmationDialog.tsx`)
- Didn't follow existing patterns in the codebase (should have studied `EditNameColorPanel.tsx`)
- Added unnecessary complexity to event system instead of using existing patterns
- Global variables and complex data flow made debugging difficult
- Tried to solve multiple problems at once instead of incrementally

**Key Lessons Learned:**
- Study existing patterns before implementing new features
- Use simpler data passing methods instead of complex event chains
- Test incrementally rather than implementing everything at once
- Follow existing codebase patterns instead of creating new ones
- Sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution

**Current State:**
- All changes have been reverted
- "Edit Thread" menu option exists but doesn't work
- No Edit Thread Panel exists
- Toast notifications for delete actions still don't work
- Need to approach this problem more systematically next time

**Documentation Created:**
- `EDIT_THREAD_ATTEMPT.md` - Comprehensive documentation of the failed attempt and lessons learned

- ✅ **Panel Transitions**: Smooth view transitions matching other panels in the app
- ✅ **Toast Notifications**: Success feedback when profile is updated
- ✅ **XP Icon Update**: Updated XP icon to Font Awesome bolt icon on profile page

**Profile Features:**
- Name display format: "First Name + Last Initial" (e.g., "John D")

**Known Issues:**
- Mobile navigation avatar color does not update in real-time (desktop works perfectly)
- Mobile avatar shows correct color on page refresh but not during live updates
- Issue appears to be CSS specificity or DOM structure related
- **EditNameColorPanel Navigation Retention Issue**: When navigating away from profile page and returning, the EditNameColorPanel does not retain the saved first name, last name, and color values. The component shows empty placeholders instead of the actual saved values. This is due to Astro template interpolation issues in Alpine.js x-data attributes. Multiple approaches have been attempted including data attributes, event-driven initialization, and direct template interpolation, but the issue persists. The API calls work correctly and data is saved properly, but the component initialization fails to display the correct values after navigation.

- ✅ **New Space Creation**: Added complete space creation functionality with dedicated `/new-space` page
- ✅ **Space Form Design**: Implemented space creation form similar to NewThreadPanel with title input and tabs

- ✅ **Persistent Navigation Integration**: Spaces now appear in persistent navigation when accessed
- ✅ **Active State Styling**: Active spaces show proper background gradient and shadow styling
- ✅ **Confirmation Dialog**: Added confirmation dialog when closing spaces (since they can't be recovered)
- ✅ **Navigation Consistency**: Spaces behave like threads in navigation - appear when accessed, closable when not active
- ✅ **Data Attributes**: Proper space data attributes for navigation tracking and active state detection

**Space Features:**
- Spaces always use "paper" color as specified
- Spaces redirect to their page after creation (`/space_id`)
- Spaces show in persistent navigation with proper active/inactive states
- Spaces require confirmation before closing (permanent removal)
- Spaces display item counts (threads + notes) in navigation

**Technical Implementation:**
- New `src/pages/new-space.astro` page with form and tab navigation
- New `src/pages/api/spaces/create.ts` API endpoint
- Enhanced `src/components/PersistentNavigation.astro` for space support
- Updated `src/pages/[id].astro` for proper space data attribute handling
- Modified navigation filtering to show active spaces (unlike threads)
- Added space-specific confirmation dialogs in close handlers

**Navigation System Updates:**
- Removed static space lists to prevent duplicates
- Spaces now only appear in persistent navigation when accessed
- Active spaces show with proper shadow styling and background gradients
- Close confirmation prevents accidental space removal
- Consistent behavior with threads but with space-specific protections
